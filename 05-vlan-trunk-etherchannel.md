# VLAN trunking protocol (VTP)

* config once, populate automatically
* VTP Domain
  * VTP server
    * new/delete/edit VLANs
  * VTP client
    * VLANs cannot be configured locally on a VTP client.
  * Transparent
    * receive and forward VTP advertisements but do not modify the local VLAN database
  * Off
    * not forward VTP messages
* VTP version
  * v1/v2: VLAN ID $\in$ [1..1005]
  * v3: VLAN id $\in$ [1..4094]

## VTP communication

* via multicast
* 3 types of advertisements
  * summary
    * link state like, every 300s
    * includes the VTP version, domain, configuration revision number, and time stamp.
  * subset
    * when change occurs
  * client request
    * when client felt it was left behind

## VTP config

```
SW1(config)# vtp version 3
09:08:11.965: %SW_VLAN-6-OLD_CONFIG_FILE_READ: Old version 2 VLAN configuration file detected and read OK. Version 3 files will be written in the future.
SW1(config)# vtp domain CISCO
09:08:12.085: %SW_VLAN-6-VTP_DOMAIN_NAME_CHG: VTP domain name changed to CiscoPress. Changing VTP domain name from CCNP to CISCO
SW1(config)# vtp mode server
Setting device to VTP Server mode for VLANS.
SW1(config)# vtp password pnet
Setting device VTP password to pnet
SW1(config)# exit
SW1# vtp primary
This system is becoming primary server for feature vlan
No conflicting VTP3 devices found.
Do you want to continue? [confirm]
09:25:02.038: %SW_VLAN-4-VTP_PRIMARY_SERVER_CHG: 0062.ec9d.c500 has become the primary server for the VLAN VTP feature
```

## VTP verify

```
show vtp status
```

## about `revision`

> It is very important that every switch that connects to a VTP domain has the VTP revi- sion number reset to 0. Failing to reset the revision number on a switch could result in the switch providing an update to the VTP server. This is not an issue if VLANs are added but is catastrophic if VLANs are removed because those VLANs will be removed throughout the domain.

> Which of the following is a common disastrous VTP problem with moving a switch from one location to another?
> b.The moved switch sends an update to the VTP server and deletes VLANs.

# Dynamic Trunking Protocol

* dynamically forming a trunk port
* two switches negotiate via Dynamic Trunking Protocol

## config

* Trunk mode
  * `switchport mode trunk`
* Dynamic desirable
  * `switchport mode dynamic desirable`
  * acts as an access port
  * but listen for and advertise DTP packets
* Dynamic auto
  * `switchport mode dynamic auto`
  * acts as an access port
  * but listen for DTP packets
  * default mode on Catalyst switches
* verify
  * `show interface [interface-id] trunk`
* disable negotiation
  * `switchport nonegotiate`
* BCP
  * > configure both ends of a link as a fixed port type (using switchport mode access or switchport mode trunk)

# EtherChannel Bundle / 802.3AD

* link aggregation spec
* form a _logical interface_ / link from multiple physical link
  * (active) _member interfaces_
  * one member down, the logical interface may still up -> redundancy
* STP operates on logical links
* can be used for access or trunk or routing
  * etherbundle = layer 1.5
* alias
  * `EtherChannel`, `EtherChannel bundle`, and `port channel`

## Dynamical Link Aggregation Protocol

* Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP)
  * standard
  * using multicast MAC address `0180:C200:0002`
  * `passive`: only listen and respond
  * `active`: sending LACP packets out
* Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP)
  * cisco proprietary
  * using multicast MAC address `0100:0CCC:CCCC`
  * `auto` and `desirable` (similar to LACP `passive` and `active` respectively)
* config

```
SW1(config)# interface range gi1/0/1-2
SW1(config-if-range)# channel-group 1 mode active
Creating a port-channel interface Port-channel 1
SW1(config-if-range)# interface port-channel 1
SW1(config-if)# switchport mode trunk

SW2(config)# interface range gi1/0/1-2
SW2(config-if-range)# channel-group 1 mode passive
Creating a port-channel interface Port-channel 1
SW2(config-if-range)# interface port-channel 1
SW2(config-if)# switchport mode trunk
```

* verify

```
show etherchannel summary
show interface port-channel <port-channel-id>
show etherchannel port
show lacp neighbor [detail]
show lacp counters
clear lacp counters
show pagp neighbor
show pagp counters
```

## Advanced LACP Configuration Options

### LACP Fast

* original LACP advertisement every 30s
* 3x loss (90s) -> member link down
* `lacp rate fast`: advertise every 1s
  * config on both ends
* link down in 3s

### Minimum Number of EtherChannel Member Interfaces

* min number of links to make bundle active and up
* `port-channel min-links <min-links>`

### Maximum Number of EtherChannel Member Interfaces

* if total number of member links > max, some links will go hot-standby
  * by comparing LACP port priority. A lower port priority is preferred. 
  * If the port priority is the same, then the lower interface number is preferred.
* `lacp max-bundle <max-links>`
> This may be done to ensure that the active member interface count proceeds with powers of two (for example, 2, 4, 8) to accommodate load-balancing hashes.

#### LACP System Priority

* to pick primary switch
  * primary sw decide which member links go active, which go hot-standy
    * lower system priority wins
* `lacp system-priority priority`

#### LACP Interface/Port Priority

* to pick which interface/port go active or hot-standy
  * lower wins
* `lacp port-priority priority`

## Troubleshooting

* all the member interfaces must have the same characteristics
  * port status: active/up
  * port type: layer2 or layer3
  * port mode: access or trunk
  * trunk port
    * native vlan id
    * allowed vlan
  * speed: must be same
  * duplex
  * MTU: for layer3 ports
  * load interval ?
  * storm control ?

## Load balancing

* `port-channel load-balance hash`
* hash()
  * dst-ip: Destination IP address
  * dst-mac: Destination MAC address
  * dst-mixed-ip-port: Destination IP address and destination TCP/UDP port
  * dst-port: Destination TCP/UDP port
  * src-dst-ip: Source and destination IP addresses
  * src-dest-ip-only: Source and destination IP addresses only
  * src-dst-mac: Source and destination MAC addresses
  * src-dst-mixed-ip-port: Source and destination IP addresses and source and destination TCP/UDP ports
  * src-dst-port: Source and destination TCP/UDP ports only
  * src-ip: Source IP address
  * src-mac: Source MAC address
  * src-mixed-ip-port: Source IP address and source TCP/UDP port
  * src-port: Source TCP/UDP port
* `show etherchannel load-balance`
* > Another critical point is that a hash is a binary function, so links should be in powers of two (for example, 2, 4, 8) to be consistent
* `show etherchannel port` to show each member link traffic
